                    <p>I'm a nerd by any other name. My dad's a computer guy and my mom's all about science and crafts. Throw in a dash of tree-hugger and fantasy-lover and you got me. I enjoy writing fantasy books, making spreadsheets to help me play video games more efficiently, and sitting outside in the rain... but I highly doubt you're reading this to find out these things. No, if you're taking the time out of your day to read this then I'm gonna guess you're looking to see if I'd be useful. What is my personallity like? Will I be a good fit on your team? Am I able to take critisium without getting butt-hurt? The long and short is, maybe. I aint gonna lie, I'm not very social with "normal" people. I avoid downtowns like they're boiling over with plauges. I don't like going to bars. I celebrate with a single Mike's Hard Lemonaide (specifically black cherry) and stay up past midnight playing the same video game I've played for years, chatting with other introverts from around the world who share my dry sarcastic sense of humor as we run dungeons, trials, raids, etc. My favorite topping for baked chicken is ketchup. I dislike Dr. Pepper, Coca Cola and Pepsi. My caffine of choice is the fruity drink packets or warm sweet southern tea (blasphemy, I know. No ice! How dare!). So, will I get along? Strictly perfessionaly, yes. Privately outside of working hours, definiate maybe. Reach out and find out.</p>
