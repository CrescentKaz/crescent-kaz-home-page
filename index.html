                    <p>I'm a nerd by any other name. I had a childhood dream job of working with fish so I got an associates of science and a bachelors of marine biology. After a few years as a lab tech I achieved my "dream job" but as most people will tell you, childhood dreams don't work out so well for adults. I left that position after about a year. I craved something that required troubleshooting and playing detective (root-cause analysis). So I transfered to quality assurance and it was here that I caught a glimpse of my new dream job. I wanted to "play" on computers. I choose to learn to code. I already knew Microsoft Office well enough and had toyed with a few basic lines in VBA. Now I wanted to see what else I could do. I took a class on Reaponsive Web Design and got this certificate, but I wanted to do more. I started taking the python course and then the javascript course, but I wanted to use it. So I did. I wrote up the first draft for The Cave but quickly realized I should start a little smaller. I scaled it back and created, "Escape the Dragon". With that under my belt I was feeling more confident so I booted up The Cave again and decided that if I was ever going to get paid for this type of stuff, I needed a way to share it. This led me to buying a domain name, but it turned out that hosting your own code from scratch was more exspensive than I thought. So after a bit more digging I found GitHub. Then after even more digging (and learning what git is), I found GitHub Pages. This is the result so far. I plan on continuing to learn and grow as a developer, but would like to make it my source of income as well. For employment considerations, please feel free to hit me up on the email below. Thanks yall, and have a good one! </p>
